# epaData.R
# Optimized functions to compute and combine EPA offense/defense summaries per game-team

#' Calculate detailed EPA metrics for offense or defense
#'
#' @param pbp_df    Data frame of play-by-play containing at least:
#'                   game_id, season, week, posteam, defteam,
#'                   home_team, away_team, epa, ep, vegas_wp,
#'                   play, pass, rush, penalty, play_type, special
#' @param side       Character, either "offense" or "defense" (default "offense").
#' @param scaled_wp  Logical, whether to scale each play's EPA by scaled Vegas win-probability before aggregation (default FALSE).
#' @return Tibble with one row per team-game and the following prefixed columns:
#'   off_plays, off_epa_sum, off_epa_mean,
