# app/data-raw/compute_model_data.R

#'' ----------------------------------------
#' Convert the “long” modeling table (one row per team‐game) into a “wide” table
#' (one row per game, with home_… and away_… prefixes on every feature).
#' ----------------------------------------
#'
#' This function expects:
#'   • model_data_long: a data frame with one row per team‐game (the output of compute_model_data_long())
#'                      It must include at least these columns:
#'                        – game_id, season, week, week_seq, team, opponent
#'                        – plus every feature column (e.g. team_elo_pre, off_total_epa_sum_cum_lag, net_off_scr_roll_lag, etc.).
#'   • game_data      : the original game_data (one row per game_id), so that we know which team is home vs. away.
#'                      It must include at least: game_id, home_team, away_team.
#'
#' It returns a tibble with one row per game_id, and all features split into home_<feature> / away_<feature>.
#'
#' @param model_data_long A data frame (one row per team‐game) containing every “net_…_lag” feature,
#'                        plus all other smoothed/lagged columns. Must include columns:
#'                          game_id, season, week, week_seq, team, opponent, plus all feature columns.
#' @param game_data       A data frame (one row per game) with columns: game_id, home_team, away_team.
#' @return A tibble with one row per game_id, and for each original feature X, two new columns:
#'         home_X and away_X.
