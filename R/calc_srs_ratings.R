# calc_srs_ratings.R
# Helper script to compute season standings and rating statistics (MOV, SOS, SRS, OSRS, DSRS)

# Dependencies: dplyr, nflverse (loaded externally in UpdateData.R)

#' Compute rating statistics (SOS, SRS, OSRS, DSRS) for a single season
#'
#' @param game_long_df        Long-format game data for one season, with columns: team, opponent, result, team_score, opponent_score
#' @param season_year  Integer specifying the season year for messaging
#' @param tol       Numeric tolerance for convergence (default 1e-3)
#' @param max_iter  Maximum iterations to attempt before stopping (default 100)
#' @param print_message Prints progress updates while looping through function
#' @return A tibble with columns team, MOV, SOS, SRS, OSRS, DSRS
#' @export
#' @noRd
