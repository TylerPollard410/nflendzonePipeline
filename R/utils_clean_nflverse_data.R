#' Reverse `nflreadr::clean_homeaway`: Pivot Long to Wide by Home/Away
#'
#' Given a data frame in “long” format (one row per team‐game, with a column
#' indicating home vs. away vs. neutral), this function will pivot back to one
#' row per game, prefixing each team‐column and any other team‐specific column
#' with `home_` or `away_`. For neutral‐site games (where both rows have
#' location == "neutral"), the first row in row‐order becomes "home_" and the
#' second becomes "away_".
#'
#' @param df A tibble or data frame in long format. Must contain:
#'   - A column (by default `game_id`) that uniquely identifies each game.
#'   - A column (by default `location`) containing at least two of:
#'     `"home"`, `"away"`, or `"neutral"` (case‐insensitive).
#'     For any `"neutral"` pair, we treat one as `home_…` and the other as `away_…`.
#'   - One column (by default `team`) identifying the team on that row.
#'   - Optionally, an `opponent` column (the opposite team), plus any number of
#'     other “team‐level” columns (scores, metrics, stats, etc.).
#' @param game_id Character name of the column that uniquely identifies a game
#'   (default: `"game_id"`).
#' @param location Character name of the column indicating `"home"`, `"away"`, or
#'   `"neutral"` (default: `"location"`). Values are matched case‐insensitively.
#' @param remove_opponent Logical; if `TRUE` (default), the resulting wide
#'   table will drop the automatic `home_opponent` and `away_opponent` columns
#'   (since they are redundant). If you need them, set this to `FALSE`.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per game. All columns except `game_id` and
#'   `location` are pivoted into two columns each: `home_<colname>` and
#'   `away_<colname>`. If `remove_opponent = TRUE`, the `home_opponent` and
#'   `away_opponent` columns are dropped before returning.

#' Add a Consecutive Week Sequence Across Seasons
#'
#' Given a data frame that contains `season` and `week` columns (e.g., `game_data` or
#' `game_data_long`), this function computes a sequential integer index (`week_seq`)
#' that increases by one for each distinct (season, week) pair in ascending order.
#' All rows sharing the same season/week receive the same `week_seq`.
#'
#' @param df A data frame or tibble containing at least two columns:
#'   - `season`: numeric or integer season identifier
#'   - `week`: numeric or integer week identifier within that season
#' @return The input `df`, with a new column `week_seq` appended.  `week_seq` is an
#'   integer that starts at 1 for the earliest season/week and increments by 1 for each
#'   subsequent distinct (season, week) pair sorted by `season` then `week`.
